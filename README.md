<h1>JoomberUI</h1>

<h3>Foundation 4 for Joomla 3</h3>

<p>JoomberUI is a fork to <a href="_QQ_"http://http://www.siegeengine.org/"_QQ_">Siege Engine</a>, a responsive template framework for Joomla built on Foundation4</p>
<p>Based on Zurb's excellent Foundation4 framework, and using some simple but robust PHP and a lot of things learned from SiegeEngine2, JoomberUI aims to be fast and flexible to use.</p>
<p>The biggest chance from <a href="_QQ_"http://http://www.siegeengine.org/"_QQ_">Siege Engine</a> is that <a href="_QQ_"http://http://www.joomberui.joomber.com/"_QQ_">Joomber UI</a> is fully <strong>SCSS</strong> ready! Once you learn the benefits of using SCSS, you will never want to go back.</p>
<p>As always, Foundation is untouched, so you can update it to your heart's content as Zurb release updates. All of the Joomla specific styling is located in our joomla.css file so you always know where to look.</p>

<p>You can see a little demo <a href="http://small-business.joomber.com/" alt="Foundation4 for Joomla3" title="JoomberUI - Foundation4 template for Joomla">Small Business</a> & <a href="http://modern-business.joomber.com/" alt="Foundation4 for Joomla3" title="JoomberUI - Foundation4 template for Joomla">Modern Business</a> of some of the very basics of what the template can do. There are no additional extensions installed in either of those sites.
